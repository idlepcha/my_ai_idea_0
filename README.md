# Can AI prevent Suicides? 

Using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing to analyze suicidal tendency in a person 

## Summary

To develop an NLP AI that can make contextual comparisons to the statements/ words/ sentiments which are more prominently exhibited by people who are either depressed or want to end their life.  



## Background

I live in the second smallest State in India but with one of the highest rates of suicides in my Country. If only I could develop an AI feature to 'understand' a person's potential tendency to end his/her life through the words and contexts the person speaks of, then we could save many lives. 

The suicide rate in Sikkim, India is close to 34 % which is the second highest in the Country. Most of then are in young age groups less than 40 years. I have also lost some people whom I knew and want to do something about this problem. 


## How is it used?

I foresee it as a multi class classifier with a deep learning (LSTM) algorithm to learn from past data of persons who might have interacted wth their friends or family or the Doctor. Initial learning could be a binary classifier (with 1 as committed and 0 saved) 


## Data sources and AI methods
The type of data I would be looking would be a corpus of words and phrases which as of now, "do NOT exist" 
A mass data collection in form of interviews, google forms, personal visits . . . itsa huge task but not undoable.



## Challenges

Greatest challenge will beto get the corpus of words and phrases. 

## What next?

This project will be a huge boon to the affected person and their family, friends. 
The AI featue can be deployed over an edgedevice and the family/ friend can record the statements of the potential persons. After the recording, the speec recognition + my AI model could give the user the 'scale' or the risl assesment before it is too late.
